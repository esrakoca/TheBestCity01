There is a large apse in the east and two small apses in the side. The main site of the church is divided into two rows of three columns and three naves,
 and the nave is wider than the other naves. The church's semicircular roof is carried by arches supported by columns. Nephtheks in the west are open to the 
 north and south. From today's residue, we understand that there are residences, schools, etc. social places in the north of the church. The church made stone
 that all of them are smooth  in the 19th century. It was used as a prison for a while. It has been restored by the Ministry of Culture.</p>

 <p><font color="red"><b>Bolaman Kalesi:</b></font>Fatsa is a famous town in the village of Bolaman. The present castle probably remained in Pontus Greeks. The wooden structure,
 built by the Treasurer family about 200 years ago, is one of the examples of our civil architecture. It is one of the most unique examples of civil 
 architecture in the Black Sea Region. In 1980, the Haznedaroglu Family donated to the Black Sea Technical University on condition that 
 the mansion was restored and opened to the public. But for many years the University had not been able to carry out the restoration, 
 it was transferred to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Restoration was completed in 2007.</p>

<p><font color="red"><b>Unye Kalesi:</b></font>There is a castle 300-400 m high, 5 km west of the township, which is said to have been a volcano in the very
 ancient times of its history and that it has extinguished over time, taking its characteristic characteristic today. In the Middle Ages,
 a number of war facilities were built on the crater of the volcano. The Kalenin platosus has a large pool which appears to have been used during wartime.
 There is a large cavity, which goes down from the ground, is filled with dipstone and earth, and a ladder of several hundred meters in length. 
 In the moments of war, it is believed that the bridge, which is interrupted by the region, provides the water need from this channel. 
 Both sides of the half-buried gate are decorated with historical and colorful paintings. It is emphasized that the gate was built at the time of the 
 second Mihirdan at a height of 5 km and in a ruined state. However, we believe that objective soundings on the castle and its skirts will illuminate
 many historical facts that have remained dark.</p><br><br>
 <p><font size=4><i>This is historical places of Ordu but I expecially suggest you vizit of teleferic. This teleferic is in the coast and goes to Boztepe and then turn back. So you can see 
the city and the see at air. This view is magnificent. Also you will see Boztepe that is famous. And also there are some beautifull natural beauty. I want to add these too. Because if you goes
Ordu you must visit that palaces.</i></font></p>
